/*
    ObstacleMap implements 2D map of obstacles in circular disk around the vehicle. The main
    design criteria is to make insert/delete/queries very fast. This is typically
    not possible in grid based approach because these operations may have large 
    constant. Current code is designed to be O(1) with small constant. This will
    enable sensors like lasers which needs much faster processing.

    We take circle and divide it in to number of ticks. If ticks=4 then circle looks
    like below with ticks marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4:

       0XXX1
      XX   XX
      XX   XX
       3XXX2

    The essential part is that tick 0 is always the first tick on left of 12 o'clock.
    Each segment between two ticks forms a cone in the circle where we will put the obstacle
    information. The segment between ticks 0-1 is 0, 1-2 is 1 and so on. So this scheme allows
    us to get the front cone always at segment 0. If we have only 4 sensors like in DJI Matrice
    Guidance system then segment 1 has information about obstacles on right, seg 2 for back and 
    so on.

    Another design criteria is that this class is thread safe for concurrent updates and queries.
    We fully expect one thread to continuously update the obstacles while another to query the map.
